In the 1st question we are reading a CSV file into a DataFrame and display basic statistics about it. Then, we are Checking if we have any null values and replaceing them with column mean value. Now we are Performing aggregation on selected columns( calories and Pulse) and filter the rows based on specified conditions.And we are gonna drop a column(Maxpulse) without creating a new dataframe but by just updating the existing one. Then we'll change data types, and handle any resulting missing values. We'll create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two columns.
In the second question, The code performs a linear regression analysis on salary data to predict salaries based on years of experience. It starts by loading the dataset and splitting it into training and testing sets. A linear regression model is then trained using the training data and evaluated on the test data, with the model's performance measured by the Mean Squared Error. Finally, the results are visualized with scatter plots for both the training and test sets, showing actual vs. predicted salaries.
